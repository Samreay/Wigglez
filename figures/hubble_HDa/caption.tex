\label{fig:hubble_diagram} The WiggleZ results of $D_{\rm A}/r_{\rm s}$ (left) and $cz/H/r_{\rm s}$ (right) in blue circles are plotted against results from AP+BAO analysis of \cite{Blake_2012} (small black circles) and BOSS \cite{Anderson_2014} (red squares), all with 68$\%$ CL regions in the $y$-axis (and redshift range on the $x$). All values are presented in Table \ref{tab:hda_wigglez_reconstructed}. The thick gray bands are $ow$CDM using Planck temperature fluctuations and WMAP9 polarization, and the thin black bands are when assuming and open $w$CDM cosmology. The dashed lines are the fiducial cosmology used in the analysis motivated by the best fit to WMAP7 data (assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM).
