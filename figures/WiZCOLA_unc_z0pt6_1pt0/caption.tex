\label{fig:wizcola_hdaUnc_z60_epsilonT15} WiZCOLA $0.6<z<1$ $\alpha_{||}$ and $\alpha_\perp$ uncertainty results. The large blue circles are realizations that have a significance of detection of 2.9$\sigma$ (same as the observation) or higher. The red are below this threshold. For comparison, the star is the WiggleZ result.
