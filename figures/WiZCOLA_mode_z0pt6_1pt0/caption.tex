\label{fig:wizcola_hdaModes_z60_epsilonT15} WiZCOLA $0.6<z<1$ $\alpha_{||}$ and $\alpha_\perp$ mode results. The large blue circles (87/600) are realizations that have a significance of detection of 2.9$\sigma$ (as the observation) or higher. The red are below this threshold. The red dot-dashed lines mark the $\pm15\%$ value of the fiducial $\epsilon$ which we use as a flat prior in this calculation. The dashed blue lines mark $\pm25\%$ of the fiducial $\alpha$, but are just for visualisation as we did not apply these as a prior. The thicker lines indicate the higher values of the $\alpha$ and $\epsilon$ limits.
